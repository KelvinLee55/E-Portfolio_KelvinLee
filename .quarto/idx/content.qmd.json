For example, let's showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset group=\"language\"}\n## R\n\n``` (.r)\ncalc_ndvi <- function(nir, red){\n  ndvi <- (nir-red)/(nir+red)\n  return(ndvi)\n}\n```\n\n(Assuming *nir* and *red* are terra rast objects)\n\n## Python\n\n``` (.python)\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir - red)/(nir + red)\n  return(ndvi)\n```\n\n(Assuming *nir* and *red* are numpy arrays)\n:::\n\n## External links\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a Google Earth Engine application I developed - which I embedded in this webpage using the code below:\n\n```{code}\n\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"700\"\nsrc=\"https://ee-melserramon.projects.earthengine.app/view/thermal-analysis-tool\">\n</iframe>\n```\n\nThe full-screen GEE application is available [here](https://ee-melserramon.projects.earthengine.app/view/thermal-analysis-tool) in case you're interested.\n\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you'd like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point. Areas where the maximum temp exceeded 35 degrees Celsius in your date-range are highlighted in red.)\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://ee-melserramon.projects.earthengine.app/view/thermal-analysis-tool\"></iframe>\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Project 1 - Capstone Deliverables\n\nThis is a sample page where you can archive project deliverables.
