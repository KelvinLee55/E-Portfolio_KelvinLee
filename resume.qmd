# Professional Experience

* ### Graduate Mapping Assistant 
**Mudge Island Citizen’s Society (M.I.C.S)** | *Aug 2025 – Apr 2026*

I worked with the non-profit organization M.I.C.S., where I developed interactive disaster response maps using QGIS and QField. I worked with GeoTIFF orthophotos, LAS/LAZ LiDAR point clouds, and vector datasets (SHP, GeoJSON, KML), which supported field-based mapping and wildfire response planning.

* ### Ecological Survey and Plantation Management Intern 
**Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), Hong Kong** | *Jun 2024 – Aug 2024*

In my role as an intern at AFCD, I contributed to tree condition inspections for NGOs, developed a seedling planting guide, and applied geospatial and data management tools, including ArcGIS Pro, to analyze data from Plantation Enrichment Programme (PEP) pilot sites.

* ### Environmental Education Intern 
**World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), Hong Kong** | *Jun 2022 – Aug 2022*

I completed an internship at WWF, during which I communicated topics related to coral reef and tiger conservation through public talks and ecotours, and developed educational materials and standard operating procedures (SOPs). These experiences strengthened my presentation skills, ability to work independently, and resilience in fast-paced settings.

* ### Field Investigator 
**Food Grace, Hong Kong** | *Oct 2021 – Jan 2022*

I was offered employment at Food Grace to interview restaurant managers about food-waste management practices.  This includes, but is not limited to, qualitative data collection, environmental reporting, and stakeholder communication. These efforts were translated into the sustainability assessment in different Hong Kong districts.
